# hum

A python synthesizer for creating and manipulating audio signals.

To install:	```pip install hum```

Note: Some functionalities depend on [pyo](https://belangeo.github.io/pyo/download.html), 
which itself requires some tools  (namely, [portaudio](https://www.portaudio.com/) 
and [Portmidi](https://github.com/PortMidi/portmidi)) that _may_ have to be 
installed manually.
