# hum

A python synthesizer for creating and manipulating audio signals.

To install:	```pip install hum```

Note: Some functionalities depend on `pyo`, which itself requires some tools 
(namely, [portaudio](https://www.portaudio.com/) and [Portmidi](https://github.com/PortMidi/portmidi)) that _may_ have to be installed manually.
